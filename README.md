# Portfolio Webpage

## A portfolio for my websites

This webpage is a portfolio of my work made using Bootstrap. It includes clickable cards of work, a skills section, complete with a link to a pop up CV, using modal, a skills and contact section with a mailto link, and finally, a footer for social links and a link to my GitHub account.

This has been created in order to display my 'online CV' and portfolio of work, and has helped to develop my Bootstrap skills, as well as further CSS, HTML and using other sites for icons, such as Font Awesome.
